The AW-B series has a maximum set pressure of 125 psi and offers embedded gauge and pressure switch options not found in the AW-A while maintaining panel mounting interchangeability with the previous AW models. Bowls on the size 30 and up are covered with a transparent bowl guard, completely protecting them from the environment and making the interior contents visible from 360 degrees. This series is part of the family of SMC modular air preparation units and can be combined with other similar sized product. The new AW-B is available in four body sizes with piping from 1/8&amp;quot; to 1&amp;quot; in Rc, NPT and G thread types.</description><bullets></bullets><preferredproduct>not-used-at-this-time</preferredproduct><breadCrumbs><breadCrumb><name>Airline Equipment</name><seoslug>Airline-Equipment</seoslug><id>15651</id></breadCrumb><breadCrumb><name>Combination Units</name><seoslug>Combination-Units</seoslug><id>15652</id></breadCrumb><breadCrumb><name>AW-B</name><seoslug>AW-B</seoslug><id>128756</id></breadCrumb></breadCrumbs><hideFromProduction>0</hideFromProduction><branchItems><branchItem><id>128758</id><seoslug>AW-B</seoslug><type>PRODUCT</type><name>AW20(*)-B to AW60(*)-B, Filter Regulator &amp;amp; Filter Regulator w/Backflow Function</name><imageS>AW_A.jpg</imageS><imageM>AW_A.jpg</imageM><imageL>AW_A.jpg</imageL><iso_symbol>filterregulator.gif</iso_symbol><series_catalog>FRL_C.pdf</series_catalog><model>AW8754F</model><collateral></collateral><configuration_doc></configuration_doc><eds_file></eds_file><description>SMC&amp;apos;S series AW-B is a combination filter/regulator, minimizing space and piping by integrating two units into one.
